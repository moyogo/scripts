"circumgraph": 'When a single vowel-sign code point produces glyphs on more than one side of the consonant base, it is referred to as a circumgraph.',

"conjunct": 'When the the shapes of constituent consonants in a cluster are changed or merged to indicate a lack of intervening vowels, this is referred to as a <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#conjunct">conjunct</a>. Not all consonant clusters are displayed as conjuncts.',

"conjunct": 'A <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#conjunct">conjunct</a> is a consonant cluster where the lack of intervening vowels is indicated by one or more of stacking, changing and merging the shapes of the constituent letter forms (usually in abugidas). Not all consonant clusters are displayed as conjuncts.',

"consonantcluster": 'A consonant cluster is a sequence of consonants with no intervening vowels.',

"independentvowel": 'An <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#inherentvowel">inherent vowel</a> is a vowel sound that is automatically pronounced after a consonant letter, unless specifically suppressed.',

"inherentvowel": 'An <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#inherentvowel">inherent vowel</a> is a vowel sound that is automatically pronounced after a consonant letter, unless specifically suppressed.',

"justification": 'The essence of justification (unlike letter-spacing) is that text is arranged to fit within a given distance, usually a line width.',

"letterspacing": 'Unlike justification, which fits text within a fixed space, letter-spacing adds regular amounts of space between letters, and the resulting length is a by-product of that.',

"materlectionis": 'In the spelling of Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages, mater lectionis refers to a consonant that is used to indicate the location of a vowel.<a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_lectionis">w</a>',

"standalonevowel": 'Standalone vowels are not preceded by a consonant sound, and may appear at the beginning or in the middle of a word.',

"grapheme": 'A <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#grapheme">grapheme</a> is a user-perceived unit of text. The Unicode Standard uses generalised rules to define \'<a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#graphemecluster">grapheme clusters</a>\', which approximate the likely grapheme boundaries in a writing system. Text operations that use graphemes as a unit of text include line-breaking, forwards deletion, cursor movement & selection, character counts, searching & matching, text insertion, line-breaking, justification, case conversions, and sorting.',

"unchecked": '\'Checked\' means ending in the sound <span class="ipa">-p</span>, <span class="ipa">-t</span>, <span class="ipa">-k</span>, or <span class="ipa">-ʔ</span>. \'Unchecked\' means ending in  sonorants <span class="ipa">m, n, ŋ, w, j</span> or vowels.</p>',

"vocalic": 'Vocalics are letters derived from Sanskrit that generally behave like vowels, but represent r/l followed by a vowel. They are often available both as vowel-signs and independent vowel letters.',

"vowelsign": '<a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#vowelsign">Vowel-signs</a> are shapes that appear alongside a consonant to express a following (non-inherent) vowel sound.  These are known as <span class="name">\'matras\'</span> in Sanskrit. Sometimes multiple shapes are used, on various sides of the base consonant (circumgraphs). ',

"wordboundary": 'The concept of \'word\' is difficult to define in any language (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/typography/linebreak.en#whatisword">What is a word?</a>). Here, a word is a vaguely-defined, but recognisable  semantic unit that is typically smaller than a phrase and may comprise one or more syllables.',
